JavaScript Console Log control by Query String
================

A JavaScript Snippet to be added just after the opening head tag.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to allow the hiding of console logs by entering a JS snippet to all pages of an App or Website.
This allows developers to add proper console log output witout worrying about users seeing the outout of errors.

## Code

The JS is built in modular form and needs to be deployed just after the opening head tag of a page.
It is in modular form and can be deployed anywhere on the page but won't catch any logs shown before the code is deployed and this is the reasoning behind the code placement.

## Outcome

I'm very happy with the outcome and as you can see the Tag Name can be anything the main reason was to keep the code tight and to allow the Tag name to be anything and the real controller is the tag Value. The tag value is set in the initial variable.
